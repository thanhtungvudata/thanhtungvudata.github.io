### Project Overview
Choosing the right crop to plant each season is a crucial decision for farmers aiming to maximize their yield and profitability. Soil health plays a significant role in crop growth, with factors such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and soil pH having a direct impact on productivity. However, assessing soil conditions can be expensive and time-consuming, leading farmers to prioritize certain metrics based on budget constraints.

In this project, we leverage machine learning to assist farmers in making data-driven decisions about which crop to plant based on essential soil characteristics. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can analyze soil composition and recommend the most suitable crop for optimal yield.

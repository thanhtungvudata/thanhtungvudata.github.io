Transformers have revolutionized the world of AI, powering models like GPT, BERT, and T5. But what actually goes on inside these models?

In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore the motivation behind transformers, the three main architectural variants (full transformer, encoder-only, and decoder-only), their best applications, and how each component works ‚Äî with practical examples and diagrams.

---

## üöÄ Motivation

Before transformers, models like RNNs and LSTMs were used for sequential data. These models process tokens **one at a time**, which limits parallelism and struggles with long-range dependencies.

**Transformers** changed the game by using **self-attention**, which allows each token to directly consider **all other tokens in the sequence simultaneously** ‚Äî capturing relationships between words, no matter how far apart they are.

This makes transformers faster to train, more scalable, and dramatically more powerful.

## üß± Transformer Architectures: Full, Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only

There are three main variants of the transformer architecture, each optimized for different types of tasks:

| Architecture     | Example Models            | Best For                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Full Transformer | T5, BART, MarianMT        | Translation, summarization, multimodal  |
| Encoder-Only     | BERT, RoBERTa             | Classification, sentence similarity, QA |
| Decoder-Only     | GPT-2/3/4, LLaMA, ChatGPT | Text generation, chat, code completion  |

### ‚úÖ Why Each Fits Its Application

- **Encoder-only** models create **contextual representations** of text ‚Äî ideal for understanding tasks.
- **Decoder-only** models generate text **token by token**, making them ideal for chat, storytelling, coding, and completion.
- **Encoder‚Äìdecoder** models separate input and output ‚Äî perfect for **sequence-to-sequence** tasks like translation.

## üß± Detailed Encoder Stack (Used in BERT, T5)

Each encoder layer in the stack follows this sequence:

### 1. Token Embeddings + Positional Encoding

#### **What it does:**
Converts each input token into a vector and adds a positional signal. 
- Each word (like ‚ÄúThe‚Äù, ‚Äúcat‚Äù, ‚Äúsleeps‚Äù) is converted into a vector of numbers that captures the meaning of the word. 
- Adds information about word order (like ‚Äúfirst‚Äù, ‚Äúsecond‚Äù, etc.) to each word vector.

#### **Why it's needed:**
- The model can't work directly with text. It needs a numerical understanding of words. These embeddings capture similarities, like "cat" and "dog" has a larger similarity than "cat" and "sleep". 
- Transformers don't know order by default. So "the cat sleeps" and "sleeps cat the" would look the same without this. Positional encoding tells the model who came before and after.

### **How it works:**

Each input token (like "The", "cat", "sleeps") is mapped to a vector using a learned **token embedding matrix**. These vectors represent the meaning of each token in a high-dimensional space. 
Let‚Äôs break it down: 

#### Token Embeddings:
Given:
- Vocabulary size:  $$V$$
- Embedding dimension: $$d$$
- Embedding matrix: $$E_{\text{token}} \in \mathbb{R}^{V \times d}$$

If your sentence is `["The", "cat", "sleeps"]`, and these map to token IDs `[12, 45, 230]`, then:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
E_{\text{token}}[12] \\
E_{\text{token}}[45] \\
E_{\text{token}}[230]
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times d}
$$

These vectors are **learned during training** via backpropagation.

#### Positional Encoding:
We add a vector to each token embedding that tells the model its position in the sequence. There are two variants:

- **Sinusoidal PE (fixed):**

$$
\text{PE}[p, 2i] = \sin\left(\frac{p}{10000^{2i/d}}\right), \quad
\text{PE}[p, 2i+1] = \cos\left(\frac{p}{10000^{2i/d}}\right)
$$

- **Learned PE:**
$$ E_{\text{pos}} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d} $$, where $$ L $$ is max sequence length.

#### Final Input:
For position $$p $$ with its implied token ID $$ t $$:

$$
X_p = E_{\text{token}}[t] + \text{PE}[p]
$$

This combined vector $$ X_p $$ which encodes both **what the word is** and **where it is** becomes the input to the first transformer layer.

### 2. Multi-Head Self-Attention

### **What it does:**
Each word looks at **all the other words** in the sentence and decides **how much attention to pay** to each of them.

### **Why it's needed:**
This helps the model understand context. Multi-head means this is done in multiple ways at once. One head might look at subject-verb, another at adjectives, etc. For example, if the word is "sleeps", attention helps it realize that "cat" is the subject performing the action.

### **How it works:**

#### 1. Linear projections for Q, K, V
Each input token vector $$ x \in \mathbb{R}^d $$ is transformed into:
- Query vector: $$ Q = xW^Q $$
- Key vector: $$ K = xW^K $$
- Value vector: $$ V = xW^V $$

where $$ W^Q, W^K, W^V \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_k} $$ are learned weight matrices, and $$ d_k $$ is typically $$ d / h $$, with $$ h $$ being the number of heads.

#### 2. Compute attention scores
For each query-key pair, compute a score:

$$
\text{score}_{ij} = \frac{Q_i \cdot K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}
$$

This measures how much token $$ i $$ should attend to token $$ j $$.

#### 3. Apply softmax
Convert scores to attention weights:

$$
\alpha_{ij} = \text{softmax}_j\left(\text{score}_{ij}\right)
$$

Each $$ \alpha_{ij} \in [0,1] $$, and $$ \sum_j \alpha_{ij} = 1 $$

#### 4. Weighted sum of values
Use the attention weights to combine the values:

$$
\text{output}_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij} V_j
$$

This is the context-aware representation for token $$ i $$.

#### 5. Do this for multiple heads
Repeat the steps above $$ h $$ times, each with its own set of learned $$ W^Q, W^K, W^V $$ matrices.

#### 6. Concatenate and project
Concatenate the output of all heads and apply a final linear projection:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(X) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h) W^O
$$

where $$ W^O \in \mathbb{R}^{(h \cdot d_k) \times d} $$ is also learned. $$ W^O $$ learns how to combine the different "perspectives" from all attention heads into a single, unified vector that can be used by the next layer. It decides how much weight to give to each head'‚Äô's output, essentially blending them into a coherent representation for each token.

#### Intuition:
- **Queries ask questions**: ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs relevant to me?‚Äù
- **Keys answer**: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what I have to offer.‚Äù
- **Values carry content**.
- Multi-head = many ways to look at the same sentence ‚Äî one head might focus on syntax, another on long-distance relationships.

Each output vector is a blend of others ‚Äî how much it blends depends on the attention scores. That‚Äôs how the model learns context.




### 3. Add & LayerNorm (Residual Block 1)

- Adds the attention output to the original input and applies LayerNorm

### 4. Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)

- Two-layer MLP with GELU or ReLU
  $$\text{FFN}(x) = W_2 \cdot \text{GELU}(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2$$
- Applied independently to each token

### 5. Add & LayerNorm (Residual Block 2)

- Adds FFN output to input of FFN and normalizes again

This block is repeated $$N$$ times to build deeper semantic understanding.

## üß± Detailed Decoder Stack (Used in GPT, T5, BART)

Each decoder layer includes all of the above **plus masking and cross-attention**:

### 1. Token Embeddings + Positional Encoding

- Same as encoder
- During training, uses **shifted input** (e.g. "Translate: The cat sleeps" ‚Üí "Le", then "Le chat", etc.)

### 2. Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention

- Tokens can **only attend to earlier positions** (causal masking)
- Prevents the model from seeing future tokens

### 3. Add & LayerNorm (Residual Block 1)

- As in encoder

### 4. Cross-Attention (Encoder-Decoder only)

- Query from decoder attends to K/V from **encoder output**
- Allows decoder to access input sentence meaning (e.g., translation)

### 5. Add & LayerNorm (Residual Block 2)

- Same structure as above

### 6. Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)

- Same as encoder

### 7. Add & LayerNorm (Residual Block 3)

- Final residual normalization

Decoder layers are also repeated $$N$$ times for generation depth.

We'll now explore each component.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add & LayerNorm (Post-Attention)

### **What it does:**
Adds the attention output back to the input and normalizes. 

### **Why it's needed:**
This helps the model not forget the original word info, and makes training stable and fast.

### **Formula:**

$$\text{LayerNorm}(X + \text{MultiHead}(X)) $$

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)

### **What it does:**
It runs a mini (2-layer) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on each word‚Äôs vector separately to help the model better understand and refine the meaning of that word in context. MLP is a specific type of FNN made of fully connected layers with nonlinear activations (e.g., ReLU or GELU).

### **Why it's needed:**
It helps the model transform the meaning of each word based on what it has learned ‚Äî like going from "noun" to "subject", or sharpening what was learned in attention.

### **Formula:**
$$ \text{FFN}(x) = W_2 \cdot \text{GELU}(W_1 x + b_1) + b_2 $$

### **Example:**
After attention figures out that "cat" is important to "sleeps", the FFN updates the "sleeps" vector to reflect this.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add & LayerNorm (Post-FFN)

### **What it does:**
Adds FFN output to its input and applies LayerNorm again.

### **Why it's needed:**
Same reason: keeps info flowing well and helps avoid forgetting or over-correcting.

## üîÅ Stack of Layers

This process is repeated N times. Each layer refines the understanding.
- Early layers learn local syntax.
- Mid layers capture sentence structure.
- Later layers understand abstract meaning.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Key Advantages of Transformer Architecture**

- **Parallel processing** of inputs.
- **Long-range dependency handling**.
- **Scalable** to massive parameter counts.
- Suitable for **pretraining + finetuning paradigm** in LLMs.

## ‚ö° **Limitations**

- **Quadratic attention complexity** w.r.t. sequence length.
- **input sequence length limit** (e.g., 2048‚Äì128K tokens).
- Memory and compute heavy.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

Decoder-only transformers like GPT have proven incredibly powerful, as they can perform many tasks **just by clever prompting**, without needing a full encoder-decoder structure.

Still, encoder-only and full transformer models are valuable in **understanding tasks** and **structured input-output tasks**, respectively.

Understanding these architectures is essential to mastering LLMs like GPT, BERT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and beyond.

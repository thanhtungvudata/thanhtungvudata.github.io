As organizations adopt Large Language Models (LLMs) across customer service, marketing, research, and product development, **rigorous evaluation** of these models becomes a business-critical capability. Poorly evaluated models can lead to misleading outputs, legal liabilities, and damaged user trust. Stakeholders ranging from **data scientists and ML engineers** to **product managers and compliance teams** need to understand how to measure LLM performance, reliability, and fitness for production.

This post dives deep into the most widely used LLM evaluation metrics, what they measure, how they work, where their limitations are, and when to use them.

## 1. Perplexity

* **What it is**: Measures how well a model predicts the next token. Lower is better.
* **Formula**: $$\text{Perplexity} = 2^{-\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log_2 P(x_i)}$$
* **How to test it**: Evaluate on a held-out validation set of token sequences.
* **Business example**: Comparing base LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 vs Claude) for internal knowledge base pretraining.
* **Limitation**: Doesn’t measure factual accuracy or task alignment.
* **When to use**: Pretraining or comparing language modeling performance.

## 2. Exact Match (EM)

* **What it is**: Binary score of 1 if output matches ground truth exactly, else 0.
* **Formula**: $$EM = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}[y_i = \hat{y}_i]}{N}$$
* **How to test it**: Compare model output to labeled ground truth.
* **Business example**: Extracting invoice numbers from customer emails.
* **Limitation**: Too strict for paraphrased or semantically similar answers.
* **When to use**: Objective tasks with single correct answers.

---

## 3. BLEU / ROUGE / METEOR

* **What it is**: N-gram overlap metrics; BLEU = precision, ROUGE = recall, METEOR = both + synonym/stemming.
* **Formula (BLEU)**: $$BLEU = BP \cdot \exp\left( \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \log p_n \right)$$
* **How to test it**: Compare model output to reference texts.
* **Business example**: Evaluating product description generation vs human-written versions.
* **Limitation**: Penalizes outputs that are correct but phrased differently.
* **When to use**: Summarization, translation, templated generation.

## 4. BERTScore

* **What it is**: Measures semantic similarity using contextual embeddings.
* **Formula**: Cosine similarity between BERT-based embeddings of output and reference.
* **How to test it**: Embed both output and reference; compute pairwise similarity.
* **Business example**: Checking if generated support answers match knowledge base entries.
* **Limitation**: Requires pre-trained language model and can be slow.
* **When to use**: Tasks where semantic correctness matters more than form.

---

## 5. Human Judgment

* **What it is**: Human evaluators rate output for relevance, helpfulness, tone, etc.
* **How to test it**: Likert scales, pairwise comparisons, user studies.
* **Business example**: User study to validate AI-generated legal summaries.
* **Limitation**: Expensive, slow, subjective, hard to scale.
* **When to use**: High-stakes or nuanced tasks (e.g., legal, policy, creative writing).

---

## 6. LLM-as-a-Judge

* **What it is**: Another LLM scores or ranks model outputs.
* **How to test it**: Provide LLM with prompts to rate or rank candidate answers.
* **Business example**: Auto-evaluating chatbot responses for enterprise support tickets.
* **Limitation**: Bias toward verbose/confident outputs; not fully trustworthy.
* **When to use**: Fast evaluation in large-scale comparative experiments.

---

## 7. Span-Level F1

* **What it is**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall for extracted token spans.
* **Formula**: $$F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{Precision \cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$
* **How to test it**: Compare predicted spans to ground truth spans.
* **Business example**: Extracting customer PII fields from unstructured text.
* **Limitation**: Requires span-level annotation.
* **When to use**: Named Entity Recognition (NER), QA, extractive summarization.

---

## 8. Faithfulness / Groundedness

* **What it is**: Measures if model outputs are supported by provided context or sources.
* **How to test it**: Human review or LLM comparison of output vs source documents.
* **Business example**: Ensuring chatbot answers align with internal policy PDFs.
* **Limitation**: No standard metric; annotation is subjective.
* **When to use**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), legal/financial AI.

---

## 9. nDCG / MRR

* **What it is**:

  * nDCG: Evaluates ranking quality (relevance + position).
  * MRR: Measures how early the first correct result appears.
* **Formula (nDCG)**:
  $$nDCG@k = \frac{DCG@k}{IDCG@k} \quad \text{where} \quad DCG@k = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{rel_i}{\log_2(i + 1)}$$
* **How to test it**: Use relevance-labeled datasets and compute for ranked lists.
* **Business example**: Ranking product FAQs by relevance to a user query.
* **Limitation**: Needs ground-truth relevance scores.
* **When to use**: RAG retrievers, semantic search, personalized recommendations.

---

## 10. Hallucination Rate

* **What it is**: % of outputs that contain unsupported or incorrect claims.
* **How to test it**: Manually annotate outputs or use LLMs for fact-checking.
* **Business example**: Monitoring a legal summarizer to ensure factual correctness.
* **Limitation**: Detection is hard to automate; high-quality labels needed.
* **When to use**: High-trust domains: healthcare, law, finance.

## Conclusion

LLM evaluation is a multi-dimensional task requiring both **quantitative rigor** and **qualitative insight**. No single metric suffices for all cases. The best practice is to combine multiple metrics, automated and human-driven, based on your application’s needs. As LLMs evolve, so must your evaluation strategy. Understand the tradeoffs, invest in tooling, and keep the feedback loop open between **engineering, product, and compliance** teams.

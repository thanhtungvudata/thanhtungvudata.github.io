### **Who Am I?**

Hi, I'm Thanh Tung! 

I'm a Data Scientist/Research Fellow, living in Sydney, Australia.

I work in a research team at Macquarie University, where I help build optimisation and machine learning models to improve the performance of mobile communication networks. The main areas I specialise in are predicting (information of wireless medium), combinatorial optimisation (deciding which user should be served, when a user is served, and how much network resource (time, power) to serve a user). 

I have a wide range of experience, including:
- Used Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to predict information of wireless medium
- Appylied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to schedule users and network resource to improve improve the performance of mobile communication networks
- Developed and deployed advanced optimisation algorithms to generate optimal solutions (to challenging non-convex problem non-convex constrained problems), which are used as data for learing to optimize the performance of mobile communication networks
- Built supervised learning models using XGBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest, to solve real-world problems (e.g., smart crop selection in farming, user default prediction in banking)

### **Technical Skills**
- Proficient:
  - Classical Machine Learning (ML): Linear/Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN, SVM
  - Deep Learning (DNN, CNN), Federated Learning
  - Optimization methods for solving constrained mix-integer and nonconvex / stochastic problems
  - Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib), Matlab, SQL
  - Optimization tools (CVX, Mosek)
- Familiar with:
  - Large Language Models (LLM), Generative AI, Reinforcement Learning
  - ML Tools (Keras, Pytorch, Gymnaslum, PySpark)
  - ML in production: Git, DVC, MLFlow, NannyML, AWS

### **Experience**
- **Research Fellow** at Macquarie University (Jul. 2023 - present), Sydney, Australia
- **Research Fellow** at Linköping University (Oct. 2022 - Jun. 2023), Linköping, Sweden
- **Research Fellow** at Queen's University Belfast (Feb. 2021 - Sep. 2022), Belfast, U.K.

### **Education**
- **PhD in Electrical Engineering** (2021), specialized in Wireless Communications, The University of Newcastle, Australia
- **MEng in Electrical Engineering** (2016), specialized in Wireless Communications, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam
- **MEng in Electronics and Telecommunications** (2016), Ho Chi Minh City University of Science, Vietnam

### **Interests**
I have passion for sciences, data science, technology (ML and AI), and soccer.

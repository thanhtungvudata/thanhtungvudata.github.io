### **Who Am I?**

Hi, I'm Thanh Tung! 

I'm a Research Fellow, living in Sydney, Australia.

I work in a research team at Macquarie University, where I help build optimisation and machine learning models to improve the performance of mobile communication networks. The main areas I specialise in are predicting (information of wireless medium), combinatorial optimisation (deciding which user should be served, when a user is served, and how much network resource (time, power) to serve a user). 

I have a wide range of experience, including:
- Using Deep Neural Networks to predict information of wireless medium
- Appying Convolutional Neural Networks to schedule users and network resource to improve improve the performance of mobile communication networks
- Develop and deploy advanced optimisation algorithms to generate optimal solutions (to challenging non-convex problem non-convex constrained problems), which are used as data for learing to optimize the performance of mobile communication networks
- Build regular supervised learning models using XGBoost, Linear Regression, Random Forest, to predict which user is going to be default for credit risk modelling

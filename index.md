Welcome to my page!

I am a data scientist with a PhD degree in wireless communications, and I am currently working at Macquarie University, Australia. My work focuses on developing optimization and machine learning solutions for predictive modeling and combinatorial optimization challenges.

In my spare time, I work on side projects and write blogs about data science and machine learning. My content ranges from technical deep dives to life skills.

If you have any questions or inquiries, please contact me via [email](mailto:tungvu.telecom@gmail.com)<i icon="fab fa-fw fa-envelope"></i>.

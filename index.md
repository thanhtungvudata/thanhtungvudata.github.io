Welcome to my page!

I am a Research Fellow with a PhD degree in Wireless Communications, currently working at Macquarie University. My work focuses on developing optimisation and machine learning solutions for predicting and combinatorial optimization problems.

In my spare time, I write blogs about data science and machine learning. My content ranges from technical deep dives to life skills.
